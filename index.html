      <summary>Entry #4: The Rising of the Shield Hero</summary>
      <p><span>September 29, 2023</span></p>
      <p>I just finished reading the first volume of The Rising of the Shield Hero by Aneko Yusagi. It's a fantasy light novel about a young man named Naofumi who is summoned to another world as one of the four legendary heroes. He is given the role of the Shield Hero, the weakest and most despised of the four. He is betrayed by his only companion and left with nothing but his shield. He has to survive in a hostile world and find a way to become stronger.</p>
      <p>I really enjoyed this light novel. It has a dark and gritty tone, but also moments of humor and heartwarming interactions. The protagonist is not your typical hero. He is cynical, distrustful, and ruthless, but also loyal, compassionate, and determined. He faces many challenges and hardships, but he never gives up. He also forms a bond with a demi-human girl named Raphtalia, who becomes his faithful companion and sword. Their relationship is one of the highlights of the story.</p>
      <p>The light novel also has an interesting system of magic and skills, based on the different weapons and shields that the heroes can use. Naofumi's shield has many abilities and forms, but he can only use defensive skills. He has to rely on his wits and creativity to overcome his enemies. He also has to deal with the politics and intrigue of the kingdom that summoned him, as well as the looming threat of the waves of calamity that threaten to destroy the world.</p>
      <p>The Rising of the Shield Hero is a light novel that will keep you hooked with its engaging plot, characters, and world-building. It's a story of adventure, betrayal, revenge, and redemption. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy and light novels.</p>

They face many challenges and enemies together as they try to reach the top floor of the tower.
